						<h2>1. Ecomorphology, convergence, and adaptation</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>How repeatable is evolution? 
							Can macroevolutionary patterns best be described as contingent on historical events or conversely 
							deterministic, producing similar phenotypes in a given environment? A good barometer of the 
							repeatability of evolution is the degree to which lineages converge on similar phenotypic solutions 
							to shared environmental pressures. Freshwater habitats, with their unique fluid dynamics, exert 
							strong selective forces on the morphology of aquatic organisms and thus present an ideal system for 
							testing ecomorphological hypotheses. My work uses phylogenetic comparative methods and 
							high-throughput phenotyping to understand ecomorphological evolution of aquatic mollusks. Thus far, 
							my collaborators and I have shown that the shells of freshwater mussels are highly convergent. In 
							large river systems, mussels evolve thicker shells and conversely thinner shells in headwater 
							streams. See <a href="https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/78/1/39/7325930">Keogh et al. 2024</a> for more information.</p>
						<h2>2. Phenotypic plasticity</h2>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>Globally, freshwater ecosystems 
							are undergoing rapid environmental change due to growing anthropogenic pressures. For aquatic 
							organisms, these complex environmental alterations represent novel physiological challenges, 
							which they must overcome in order to survive and reproduce. One strategy to maintain resilience 
							to environmental uncertainty is phenotypic plasticity, whereby a single genotype can develop 
							multiple phenotypes based on environmental cues. 
							Phenotypic plasticity has been shown to be a major biological mechanism in which organisms respond 
							to rapidly changing environments, including climate change. My collaborators and I have ran
							multiple common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments to identify plastic responses of 
							freshwater mussels. We are currently using RNAseq of transplanted mussels to try to understand the 
							molecular pathways of plasticity. See <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fwb.14358">Keogh et al. 2025</a> for a representative publication.</p>
						<h2>3. Speciation and biogeography</h2>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Fig1D.jpg" alt="" /></span>The isolated river drainages of 
							eastern North America experienced repeated glacial expansion and recession throughout the Cenozoic, 
							resulting in cyclical periods of coalescence and isolation between neighboring river systems. 
							Landscape evolution mediated by climate change appears to be partially responsible for the great 
							diversity of freshwater mussels. Phylogeography and divergence dating of multiple mussel species 
							frequently show congruence between the timing of historical climatic fluctuations and 
							diversification events, suggesting drainage capture and isolation have played a dramatic role in the
							proliferation of aquatic diversity. Concurrently, freshwater mollusks are one of the most imperiled
							groups of animals globally. Ongoing species delimitation and conservation genomic work, identifying
							new species and areas of high endemism, is critical to conserve these ecological engineers.
